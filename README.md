# Welcoming Communities for Refugees Challenge

We are looking to use data and technology to create a sense of belonging for refugees resettled in the United States in addition to understanding how refugees thrive in their communities. 

The challenge objectives will evaluate the above goals individually and in conjunction with each other. One objective will approach the challenge by understanding the current experience of refugees resettled in the United States. Another objective will identify new data and technologies that can better create belonging for refugees upon resettlement. Finally, these objectives will be combined to create a comprehensive understanding of resettled refugees in the United States.

For more details, please visit the challenge brief. 

`potential_characteristics` is a list of characteristics that might be useful in identifying welcoming communities, but the list is not exhaustive, and we welcome new ideas. 

Because of the nature of this project, there are several available datasets on refugees. A high-level overview of the datasets is provided in `dataset_description`. Please start here as most of the basic statistics on refugees admitted by state are contained here.
